# HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp Portfolio

Welcome to my repository for the projects and assignments completed during my journey through the HyperionDev Data Science bootcamp. This repository showcases my progress and growth as a data scientist, featuring a collection of projects, exercises, and assignments completed throughout the course.

## About the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp

The HyperionDev Data Science bootcamp is a comprehensive program designed to provide students with a strong foundation in data science principles, techniques, and tools. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Python programming
- Data manipulation and analysis with pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Machine learning algorithms and techniques
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deep learning and neural networks
- Natural language processing (NLP)

## Projects and Assignments

This repository contains a variety of projects and assignments completed during the bootcamp. Each project demonstrates my skills and knowledge in different areas of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and more.

# Descriptions

## Capsone Project - NLP sentiment prediction 

1. Description 
The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews. It contains various columns such as ID, date added, date updated, reviews, ratings, and usernames. We are particularly interested in the 'reviews.text' column for sentiment analysis.

2. Details of Preprocessing Steps
I performed basic preprocessing steps to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis. This included removing missing values and applying text normalization techniques such as converting text to lowercase and removing punctuation.

3. Evaluation of Results
We tested our sentiment analysis model on a few sample product reviews. The model provided sentiment scores indicating the polarity and subjectivity of each review. Additionally, we calculated the similarity between two random product reviews using spaCy's similarity function.

4. Strengths and Limitations
Strengths:

The model can accurately determine the sentiment of product reviews.
SpaCy's similarity function provides a quantitative measure of similarity between reviews.

Limitations:

The model's accuracy may vary depending on the complexity and context of the reviews.
Basic preprocessing steps may not capture all nuances of the text data, potentially affecting sentiment analysis results.
